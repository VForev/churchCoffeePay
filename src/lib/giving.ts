/**
 * Pushpay giving — the church's real donation platform, used for the "give" box shown
 * after an order is placed and on the live order screen.
 *
 * This is separate from the donation box at checkout. That one is a line on the coffee
 * order, charged through Stripe and stored in `orders.tip_amount`. This one hands the
 * person off to Pushpay and never touches our database — the money goes straight to the
 * church, and nothing here knows or records whether they gave.
 *
 * It is a plain link, not Pushpay's embedded widget. The widget keeps people on our page,
 * but it's a third-party script: church wifi and strict mobile browsers block it often
 * enough that a giving box which only works sometimes is worse than one that always works.
 *
 * Both values below are public — they ship in the page. To point this at a different
 * Pushpay campaign, replace the link with the new one.
